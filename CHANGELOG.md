  - `OpenRouterClient::quick()` - Minimal development setup
  - `OpenRouterClient::production()` - Production-ready configuration
- Enhanced builder pattern with better error messages and validation
- Improved URL validation with specific format expectations
- Added timeout and retry convenience methods (`with_timeout_secs`, `with_retries`)

## Security Advisories

### Known Issues
- `instant` crate (v0.1.13) is unmaintained but used indirectly through dependency chain
  - **Impact**: Low - Used only in development/test dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: No direct security impact on production usage
  - **Status**: Monitoring for dependency updates

---

## Breaking Changes

### v0.1.4

1. **SecureApiKey Introduction**
   ```rust
   // OLD (v0.1.3 and earlier)
   let client = OpenRouterClient::new()
       .with_api_key("sk-key")?;
   
   // NEW (v0.1.4+) - Still supported, automatically wrapped
   let client = OpenRouterClient::new()
       .with_api_key("sk-key")?;
   
   // NEW - Explicit SecureApiKey usage
   let secure_key = SecureApiKey::new("sk-key")?;
   let client = OpenRouterClient::new()
       .with_secure_api_key(secure_key)?;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Types**
   - Error messages are now automatically redacted for security
   - More detailed error context and metadata available
   - Some error message formats may have changed

3. **Validation Changes**
   - Stricter API key validation (minimum length, format checks)
   - Enhanced input validation for all request parameters
   - Some previously accepted invalid inputs may now return errors

---

## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.3 to v0.1.4

1. **No code changes required** for most users - the API remains backward compatible
2. **Recommended changes** for enhanced security:
   ```rust
   // Use new convenience constructors
   let client = OpenRouterClient::from_env()?;
   
   // Or for production
   let client = OpenRouterClient::production(
       "sk-key",
       "My App",
       "https://myapp.com"
   )?;
   ```
3. **Test updates** may be needed if you're testing error messages
4. **Environment variables**: Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OR_API_KEY`
